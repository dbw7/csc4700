What is your favorite movie?
Get Out or Whiplash or Knives Out or so


If you could go anywhere in the world for vacation, where would it be?
Greece

If you could have any super power, what would it be (and why that power)?
This isn't my final answer, but is the answer I'm in the mood for at 9:17pm on 
a wednesday night.

A super power where I summon a wheel of fortune and I have to spin it and
whatever it lands on is the superpower I must use before it goes away.

I feel like this gives me a variety of powers with a fair drawback and would
be fun.
