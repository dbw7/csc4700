Title: Funky Galileo
Artist: Sure Sure

Lyrics:
Pour another glass of wine
Baby, I could die tonight
Dancing 'til I fall
Everybody tells me, "Son, we don't move around the sun"
Well, I'll show them all


Watch me move, cross the room
Like I'm crazy
They all say, "Funky Galileo got that fever"


Looking up at the sky
Don't you ever wonder why?
We were meant to be
All the ladies tell me, "Dude, let me see you walk the moon"
Someone hold my drink


Watch me slide, run and hide
Like I'm crazy
They all say, "Funky Galileo got that fever"
Oh no, oh no
I've got that fever
Oh no, oh no, no, no, no


And I've been feeling so pent up
Like an ocean in a bathtub
Nobody seems to understand
They're calling me an evil man
When all I wanna do is dance


Watch me slide, run and hide
Like I'm crazy
They all say, "Funky Galileo got that fever"
Oh no, oh no
I've got that fever
Oh no, oh no, no, no, no
Fever, oh no, oh no
I've got that fever
Oh, no
